# ONEMILREG

Main goal of this project is to try to replicate a study that I found a few months ago (I Just Ran Two Million Regressions Xavier X. Sala-I-Martin, published in The American Economic Review)

Firstly, I loaded the data into R, then reported main summary statistics of the main variables of interest, so I would have a clue about my dataset.Then decided on my dependent  variable and  which  were mine main  independent  variables (in the study author always had regressions with seven explanatory variables, three of those are the so-called fixed variables, i.e. they appeared in all of the regressions) I also decided to  keep only the observations, where the information for the dependent variable and the three fixed variables were non-missing.

After, I ran the “fixed” regression (i.e.  only  with  a  constant  and  the  three  fixed  variables)

Furthermore, 22 variables (not including the three fixed-variables) are reported as on average being statistically significant in the study. I ran 13 regressions with different variable combinations following the study. Each variable from the study appeared in at least 2regressions. 

Lastly, reported the variables and interpreted them.
